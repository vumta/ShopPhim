Hi,
I have investigated and fixed this issue.
The root cause was that the Google form was automatically updated to a new version, but the two forms for bulk orders were not updated, which caused this link to become inaccessible.
I have updated both forms to the latest version.
Could you please check if you can access the forms again?
You can refer to Googleâ€™s announcement via the attached link below.

Do you want me to make this sound more formal and business-like for email communication?
